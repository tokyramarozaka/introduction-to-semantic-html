# introduction-to-semantic-html
A very basic example on how semantic elements can be useful. 

# Why semantic HTML ? 
Semantic HTML introduces meaning to the code we write. Before Semantic HTML the elements didnâ€™t have any meaning as to what it does or what content goes in it. 

An element such as `<div>` was used as a general-purpose element to create things from headers to footers to articles. 

With Semantic HTML we were introduced to elements that tell developers and browsers exactly what it does and what content should go in it.
